# Node Manager Application Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the functional and non-functional requirements for a Node Manager Application for Spacemesh nodes. This GUI will enable users to easily manage their node, participate in the network, and interact with the Spacemesh blockchain.

### Scope

The application will provide functionalities for setting up a node, monitoring its status, executing transactions, participating in consensus, and accessing blockchain data.

## 2. Overall Description

### User Needs

* Easy setup and management of a Spacemesh node
* Easy and transparent smesh coins mining
* Monitoring node health and performance
* Interacting with smart contracts (future)
* Participating in the network's consensus mechanism

### Assumptions and Dependencies

* Users have basic knowledge of blockchain technology
* The minimum hardware requirements are met and the app doesn't cover edge cases of the users' expectations and issues
* Dependence on the Spacemesh network's availability and performance

## 3. System Features and Requirements

### Setup and Configuration

* Wizard for initial node setup and configuration
* Options to configure node parameters (e.g., for PoST, network/p2p related setup)

### Node Management

* Start, stop, and restart node operations
* Real-time display of node status, including connection status, consensus participation, and sync status
* Automated updates for node software

### Monitoring and Analytics

* Dashboard to display key performance indicators (KPIs) such as block creation rate, transaction processing time, and network bandwidth usage
* Graphs and statistics for historical performance analysis
* Notification system for critical events and alerts

### Smart Contracts and dApps (future)

* Interface for deploying and interacting with smart contracts
* Directory or marketplace for discovering and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps)

### Networking

* View and manage peer connections
* Configure networking settings for optimal performance and security

### Security

* Encryption for all sensitive data stored by the application
* Secure communication with the Spacemesh network
* Backup and recovery options for wallets and application data

### Help and Support

* Comprehensive user guide and FAQ section
* Contact support via email or chat from within the application

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

* The application should ensure minimal performance impact on node operations.
* Response times for user actions should not exceed 2 seconds under normal conditions.

### Usability

* The GUI should be intuitive and easy to use for users with different levels of expertise.
* The application should provide tooltips and help for complex features.
