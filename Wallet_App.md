* **Responsiveness:** The app should perform actions quickly, with minimal latency.
* **Scalability:** Capable of handling a growing number of users and transactions.

### Security

* **Encryption:** Use strong encryption methods for data storage and transmission.
* **Two-Factor Authentication:** Optional additional security layer for accessing wallets.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Technologies suitable for web (and potentially Electron for desktop version) development, such as React.js or Vue.js.
* **Backend:** Leverage the Spacemesh public API for backend operations. This includes transaction processing, account management, and real-time data fetching. Ensure the app's backend is capable of handling API updates and changes efficiently. (TO BE UPDATED)
* **Integration:** Ensure compatibility with SMCLI
* **Backend Integration:**
* **Desktop Version:** For the desktop version, utilize Electron or a similar framework to create a cross-platform application. This approach allows for code reuse from the web app, reducing development time and effort.
* **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate all user inputs before processing to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
* **Error Handling:** Develop comprehensive error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage API errors, network issues, and unexpected data formats.
* **Activity Logging:** Implement logging for all API interactions, tracking request data, response times, and any errors encountered.
* **Performance Monitoring:** Use monitoring tools to continuously track the backend's performance, with alerts for any issues that could impact user experience.
* **Optimization:** Optimize API calls by batching requests, caching and using asynchronous operations where possible.

### Deployment

* **Web Application:** Host on a secure, scalable cloud platform.
* **Desktop Application:** Package using Electron or similar technology for easy installation across different OS.

## 5. Design Requirements

### User Interface (UI)

* **Design:** Clean, user-friendly interface that aligns with Spacemesh branding.
* **Responsiveness:** Ensure the app is fully responsive and usable across devices.

### User Experience (UX)

* **Simplicity:** Streamline user flows to make wallet management intuitive.
* **Feedback:** Provide real-time feedback for user actions (e.g., transaction confirmation).
* **Limit the steps and decisions expected from the users wherever possible**
* **legends and explanations for the statuses, tooltips, help and FAQ sections, and errors explicitly described and preferably pointing at the potential issue.
  Users need to understand what is happening under the hood**
* "Coinbase” should probably be changed to something else, it confuses people
* **Updates information -** notifications and info on what’s new

## 6. Regulatory and Compliance Requirements

* **Legal Compliance:** Adhere to relevant cryptocurrency regulations and data protection laws.
