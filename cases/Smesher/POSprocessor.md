#### Test Case ID: POSProcessor-05

**Description:** Verify automatic processor selection when skipping the benchmark.

**Steps:**

1. Begin POS setup in Smapp.
2. During the processor benchmarking, choose to skip the step.
3. Observe which processor is selected automatically.

**Test Data:** User action to skip the benchmark process.

**Expected Result:** The fastest processor is automatically selected when the benchmark is skipped.

---

#### Test Case ID: POSProcessor-06

**Description:** Check the compatibility of the POS Processor module with different operating systems.

**Steps:**

1. Install Smapp on various operating systems.
2. Attempt to run POS setup and reach the processor selection step.
3. Observe processor detection and benchmarking behavior

**Test Data:** different operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

**Expected Result:** POS Processor module functions correctly across different operating systems, with processors properly detected and benchmarked.
